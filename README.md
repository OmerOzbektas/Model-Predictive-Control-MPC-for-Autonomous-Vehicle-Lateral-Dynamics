# Model-Predictive-Control-MPC-for-Autonomous-Vehicle-Lateral-Dynamics
This project implements a modern Model Predictive Controller for an autonomous vehicle’s lateral dynamics using a dynamic bicycle model. The simulation includes real-time animation, reference generation, and MPC prediction matrices built from scratch.
